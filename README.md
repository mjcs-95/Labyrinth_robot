# Labyrinth dimensions
The Labyrinth was a 5x5 matrix of square cells.

The width of the cells was 20cm, and the height of the wall was 15cm.

The cells where white, and the change of cell was indicated on the floor with black lines separating them.

The robot has been designed to start on a corner cell, better if is in the right corner so it will be easier to follow the draw in the python application.
